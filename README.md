# Keypad-Servo-Lastkeys

Keypad Code game where the correct code needs to be entered into a keypad.

Players need to enter a 4 digit code into a keypad currently attached to a vending machine which dispenses plastic eggs. Due to the nature of the game the keypad symbols have been replaced and as such an 'ENTER' button is not appropriate. Therefore the puzzle is considered solved when the last 4 keypresses are equal to the password.

Vending machine is triggered by a servo pressing the microswitch from its old coinslot mechanism.
